              I am a front-end developer living near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (able and available to relocate anywhere) and I'm looking to help your organization build and maintain modern responsive web pages.
              I have focused on building applications using React on the front-end, SQL (or postgresql/sqlite) on the backend and node.js to handle traffic. I've also built scrapers and tools using Python3, Ruby (RoR), Angular, and ASP.NET. Professionally I've worked at a business-to-business CMS company (KSA&D) where I contributed mostly to satisfy the front-end needs of clients but I also co-developed the <a style='color:blue' href='https://www.bethlehem-pa.gov/'>City of Bethlehem's new site</a> and made PHP forms for client listservs. 
              
              All of my work is on my github and I'm comfortable using git from the command line.

            <p>
              I have a B.A. in Political Science and Philosophy and 40 credits earned towards a PhD in School Psychology. I've found that my educational background has given me excellent command of the english language and critical thinking skills that have allowed me to contribute to projects and decisions sometimes beyond the scope of my position.

            <p>
              My web development career began in 2016 with the help of a long-time friend and senior full-stack developer. In 2017 I attended a highly selective (less than 3% acceptance rate) 6-month 80hrs/week full-stack web development training program in San Francisco called appAcademy where I built full-stack apps in a collaborative environment using Rails, SQL, React, and Node.js. At appAcademy I went "under the hood" to understand and implement built-in javascript and ruby methods, I learned about web sockets and built servers running node.js, I used metaprogramming to gain insight into complex programming practices, and implemented higher-level computer science topics such as stacks and queues, recursion, and sorting.

                <p class='text-center'>
                  I developed this youtube clone with React and the Redux library. I used the "create-react-app" library for easy transition to hosting on Github Pages.
                  This application is very very fast. I designed the search bar to make youtube API calls as you type
                  so you'll see the application populate relevant videos even before you're finished typing.
                  Making API calls in this manner is not efficient at all and wastes a lot of resources but 
                  it's so fast and this is a small personal application so I kept it as-is because, if anything, it's neat to see how 
                  quickly the browser can send and receive data.

                  <p class='text-center'>
                    A weather application that I made using React. It uses the DarkSky weather API to perform an asynchronous call to locate 
                    your current location then the application renders a succinct overview of current weather conditions in addition to two 
                    nice visualizations of how the weather in your area will be in 12, 24, and 48 hours

                  <p class='text-center'>
                  I put this together using javascript and basic HTML/CSS. This application will
                  record speech in real time assuming you have a microphone available. Initially I had run into a problem with the 
                  blazing-fast speed in which the application would try and render a user's speech on the screen. 
                  I found that by including a few timeouts I could delay the program's lookup time and improve the accuracy of the speech recorded. 
                  I even trained it to incorporate basic punctuation so the rendered text looks more representitive of proper sentence structure.

                    I put this together using React.js. I wanted to learn how to make API calls 
                    so I build this widget that calls giphy.com to pull and display trending gifs. 
                    I also implemented a search-bar that can make API calls and return many related gifs.
